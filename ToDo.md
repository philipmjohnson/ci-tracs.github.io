# TO DO

* Use HPC as prerequisite, define prerequisite object within the module for use elsewhere.
* Create a Jupyter Notebook/lab module, define the prerequisite version. 
* Update Morea docs to show how to do prerequisites within a site.
* Create two assessments: one of user's learning, and one of user's perception of utility of module.
* Advantages of Morea:
  * Aggregation within site allows interlinking 
  * structure provides uniformity, helps instructors to provide all components. 

* Investigate TocBot: http://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/
