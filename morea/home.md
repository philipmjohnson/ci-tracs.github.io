## Welcome to CI-TRACS

You have reached the home page for the University of Hawaii CyberInsfrastructure TRaining to Advance Climate Science (CI-TRACS) project. This site provides access to a number of modules, many of which provide access to materials in support of one day workshops presented by the CI-TRACS team.  

## About this site

Each CI-TRACS workshop is represented as a separate module. Each workshop module has one or more of the following components:

  * [Prerequisites](/prerequisites), describing skills you should acquire in order to be ready for the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/readings), providing background or reference material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/experiences), providing a structured set of exercises enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

In addition, there are a few non-Workshop modules that provide useful additional information for CI-TRACS.
