If this assessment existed, it would provide some sort of activity that users could undertake in order to assess whether or not they learned the important concepts and skills associated with this workshop.

It could be, but doesn't have to be, a "test". And it could, or could not, be provided back to workshop organizers.

Since many users are taking the workshop to support their own research, the assessment exercise could be to try to apply these concepts to their research and report back on how successful they were.
