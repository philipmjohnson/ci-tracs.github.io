<h2 id="welcome-to-ci-tracs">Welcome to CI-TRACS</h2>

<p>You have reached the home page for the University of Hawaii CyberInsfrastructure TRaining to Advance Climate Science (CI-TRACS) project. This site provides access to a number of modules, many of which provide access to materials in support of one day workshops presented by the CI-TRACS team.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>

<p>Each CI-TRACS workshop is represented as a separate module. Each workshop module has one or more of the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>, describing skills you should acquire in order to be ready for the module.</li>
  <li><a href="/outcomes">Learning outcomes</a>, describing the major goals for the module.</li>
  <li><a href="/readings">Readings and other online resources</a>, providing background or reference material.</li>
  <li><a href="/experiences">Experiential learning activities</a>, providing a structured set of exercises enabling you to acquire mastery of material.</li>
  <li><a href="/assessments">Assessments</a>, which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are a few non-Workshop modules that provide useful additional information for CI-TRACS.</p>
