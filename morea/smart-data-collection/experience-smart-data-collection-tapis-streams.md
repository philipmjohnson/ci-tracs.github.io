**Questions**
  * How can we use the Streams API to mimick a real-world sensor network?

**Objectives**
  * How to use the Tapis Streams and Abaco APIs with the python tapipy library.
</div>

## Overview

We will be using this Jupyter notebook to generate a mock sensor with temperature and rainfall data. This will demonstrate how the streams API could be used for real-time climatological data. You will use the provided TACC login credentials (or your own if you have a personal TACC account) to authenticate with Tapis.

You will generate Project, Site, Instrument, Variable, and Measurement definitions through the API. We will be generating random temperature and rainfall data, but in a real-world scenario this data could be generated by a physical sensor station and submitted to the API when the measurement is taken either by the device itself, or by a separate system receiving data from the sensor station.

Once the mock station data is created, we will demonstrate the use of Abaco notifiers. Actors can be registered and conditionally triggered by measurements as they are created.


## Key Points

* The Streams API provides methods for creating representations of sensor stations and measurements for storage and retrieval.
