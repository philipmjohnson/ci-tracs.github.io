## Preparation 

Today we will be using Mana  so you will require an account in order to run the Jupyter notebooks.

We will also be using a Jetstream Virtual machine as a system for Tapis to send and pull files from.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-user-pen fa-xl"></i>  **Login to Mana**
<hr/>

To access the server you can ssh in with:

```ssh
ssh username@129.114.17.86
```

You will recieve an account and password from the instructors.
